# SingWellWeb


This is the README for the web version of the new Choir Connect application. Note that before you jump into the code that this was written over the span of 9 months with two new React developers, so there are certainly hoops that we had to jump through where the solutions might not have been the best solution, but it was the solution that we came up with at the time. 


The web version of Choir Connect is meant for choir directors to be able to easily connect with their choirs. They do this by creating organizations, underneath these organizations is where their choirs live. Choirs then have events that the director creates. These events have programs which are constructed using the music from their music library. In order to effectively create an event, the organization must have the necessary music in their music library. From an associated music page the director can add resources like an MXL file which will allow the choir users on the mobile app side to practice the associated song.
